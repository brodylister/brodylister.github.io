### CPSC 120

* Lab 10

    Lab 10 was a favorite because it was the first time that we really got to work with data structures and file I/O. In Part 1, I wrote a program that could organize Californiaâ€™s population data by county. I liked it because I learned how to utilize file I/O syntax properly, and it felt like the first time we were making an actual useful program.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11 was a favorite because it was the first time we began using object-oriented programming and created our first class. In Part 1, we recreated the state demographics from Lab 10 Part 2, but in Part 2, we used the OOP concepts to make a number guessing game. I enjoyed Part 2 because the program could finally run on its own, and the game was playable. We also learned about random number generation.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 was definitely my favorite of the whole course, specifically Part 1. We had used file I/O before this, but this was the first time we created an image, specifically a .gif. Additionally, we used lookup tables to simplify the sine function, and it was the first time we used an API to help with image generation. This resulted in a really cool animated image from scratch.
